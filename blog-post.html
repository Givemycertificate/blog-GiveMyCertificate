                At present, whenever someone plans to organize an event, the organizer is already acquainted 
                to the process of delivering certificates and the forgery cases which are witnessed with 
                certificates which are not verifiable. So GiveMyCertificate is the best option at service
                 if you are planning to organize an event. You can take registrations from the platform 
                 itself and deliver verifiable certificates after the event. This helps in managing the 
                 events without any hassle. GiveMyCertificate's services are satisfactorily economical,
                  even for small communities and new start-ups. You can start with the free plan for demo 
                  and witness their service yourself.

                There are no unnecessary formalities or any documentation problem. The issuing authority is 
                only supposed to provide a list of the recipients (in excel sheet format) and the certificate 
                design. Rest is taken care by GiveMyCertifcate itself, from generating certificates to sending 
                them, with just one click.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most unique feature which makes GiveMyCertificate stand out is their concept of ‘Karma
                 Score’. It is a score which represents all the achievements of an individual, accomplished 
                 in schools and colleges. This is very useful because most of the accomplishments are not 
                 recognized by employers when people go for jobs. This means most of the certificates which 
                 they earn with hard work become useless and all the efforts they had put in accomplishing
                  those feats are neglected. The “Karma score” prevents this and turns all the accomplishments 
                  into a score by verifying all the certificates belonging to a person, which can be shown to 
                  any employer later on by using it in his/her resume.
              </p>

              There are some websites where students find courses to embellish their skill set. These websites
               look better when a certificate is generated right at the moment when a course reaches 
               completion. If you own such a website and wish to verify and deliver certificates from there, 
               you can use GiveMyCertificate’s API integration service and your customers will receive 
               verifiable certificates on completing every course. Moreover, their services are not limited to
                certificates, but you can even make verifiable degrees, offer letters, recommendation letters,
                 etc.
