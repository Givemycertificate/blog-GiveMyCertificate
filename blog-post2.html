                <h2><b>Why do you need a verifiable certificate?</b></h2>

                  A verifiable certificate, as it says, is a certificate which can be verified. 
                  Such certificates bear a code which works as the verification credential for the 
                  certificate. This code is usually termed as certificate ID. Verifiable certificates 
                  are of more worth when compared to normal certificates which students keep collecting.
                   So it is important for students to keep checks on the validation of their certificates
                    and equally necessary for organizations which offer certificates for different tasks and 
                    courses.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In recent years, both need and demand for verifiable certificates has risen with the 
                  malpractice of creating fake certificates. There are students out there who are burning 
                  the sheep to improve their horizon and ability. They attend training programs, informative
                   webinars and opt for costly courses, and collect certificates as proofs for their 
                   accomplishments. But many people generate fake certificates and use it later on to prove 
                   accomplishments which they never made. Such fraudulent cases have become common with
                    e-certificates. Due to this, trust of students is getting moved towards organizations 
                    delivering certificates with a verification ID and also, many educational companies are 
                    approaching organizations that create verifiable certificates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  GiveMyCertificate is one of such organizations which not only create verifiable certificates
                   but their concept of ‘karma score’ also makes it easier to keep track of all the 
                   accomplishments of a person. It is evident that every certificate collected cannot be
                    carried around while applying for jobs to highlight experiences and skills. The ‘karma 
                    score’ is actually a score which is generated based on a person’s accomplishments and 
                    certificates, and thus can be used to easily highlight the value of each credential.
                     It helps a person to make each of his/her certificates valuable. Moreover, the services
                      are convenient, faster and economical. All the work from generating and validating to 
                      delivering the certificates is handled by GiveMyCertificate itself and much faster than 
                      other service providers.
